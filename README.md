1. Fundamentals of Web Development: Start by building a portfolio site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This site will serve as a frontend for your future apps and services. Also, make sure to include a contact form for potential leads.

2. Version Control: Before you start writing any more code, set up a Git repository for your project. Commit changes regularly and push them to a remote repository on GitHub.

3. Backend Development:
• Node.js: Create a REST API using Express.js that will handle requests from the contact form on your portfolio site.
• Python: Build a microservice using Flask or Django that manages an inventory app.
• Java: Develop another microservice using Spring Boot that handles user authentication.
• Ruby: Wrap all these services into a Ruby on Rails application that serves as a unified platform.
4. Frontend Development: Select a framework among React, Angular, or Vue.js to create a dynamic interface for your inventory app and integrate it into your portfolio site.

5. DevOps:
• CI/CD: Set up a Jenkins pipeline for your project. It should automate build, test, and deployment processes. Start this step before you get too deep into backend development to catch any potential issues early.
• Docker: Dockerize your applications. Write Dockerfiles and create Docker images for your Node.js, Python, Java, and Ruby apps.
• Kubernetes: Deploy your Dockerized applications on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
6. Cloud Computing: Use Azure services to host your applications and manage resources.
• Azure App Service: Deploy your portfolio site and Ruby on Rails application.
• Azure Functions: Use for running serverless functions like handling form submissions.
• Azure Container Instances or AKS: Deploy your Docker containers.

7. API Development and Integration:
• Connect your Node.js API with Microsoft Power Automate to create a flow that, when the contact form is submitted, creates a lead in your CRM (Asana).
• Use Postman to test the API endpoints you have developed.

8. Deployment and Monitoring:
• Deployment Strategies: Implement a blue-green deployment for your application using Azure DevOps.
• Prometheus: Set up Prometheus on Azure to monitor your applications.
• Grafana: Visualize your Prometheus metrics in a Grafana dashboard.
• ELK stack: Set up an ELK stack on Azure for centralized logging.

9. Security:
• Web Application Security: Review your web applications against the OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities and implement measures to address them.
• IAM: Use Azure Active Directory to manage user identities and access policies.

10. Testing and Quality Assurance:
• Unit Testing: Write unit tests for your applications using Jest.
• Integration Testing: Write integration tests for your applications using Cypress.
Continuous Testing: Implement continuous testing in your Jenkins pipeline.
